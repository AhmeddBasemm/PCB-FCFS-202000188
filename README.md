Description:
This program implements a FIFO queue using a linked list to store PCBs <br>
The program creates some PCBs and adds them to the queue <br>
The program then removes the first process from the queue and prints its information <br>
The program then prints the information of the remaining processes in the queue <br>
The program then frees the memory allocated for the removed process <br>
The program then prints the information of the remaining processes in the queue
